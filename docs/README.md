## Overview
SmartIR is a custom integration for controlling **climate devices**, **media players** and **fans** via infrared controllers.<br>
SmartIR currently supports the following controllers:
* [Broadlink](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/broadlink/)
* [Xiaomi IR Remote (ChuangmiIr)](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/remote.xiaomi_miio/)
* [LOOK.in Remote](http://look-in.club/devices/remote)
* [ESPHome User-defined service for remote transmitter](https://esphome.io/components/api.html#user-defined-services)
* [MQTT Publish service](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/service/)

More than 120 climate devices are currently supported out-of-the-box, mainly for the Broadlink controller, thanks to our awesome community.<br><br>

## Installation
### *Manual*
Place the `custom_components` folder in your configuration directory (or add its contents to an existing `custom_components` folder).
It should look similar to this:
```
<config directory>/
|-- custom_components/
|   |-- smartir/
|       |-- __init__.py
|       |-- climate.py
        |-- controller.py
|       |-- fan.py
|       |-- media_player.py
|       |-- codes/
|           |-- climate/
|               |-- 1000.json
|               |-- .....
|           |-- fan/
|               |-- 1000.json
|               |-- .....
|           |-- media_player/
|               |-- 1000.json
|               |-- .....
```

### *HACS*
If you want HACS to handle installation and updates, add SmartIR as a [custom repository](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories/). In this case, it is recommended that you turn off automatic updates, as above.
